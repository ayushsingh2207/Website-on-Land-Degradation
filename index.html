                Land degradation means reduction or loss, in arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid areas, of the biological or economic productivity and 
                complexity of rainfed cropland, irrigated cropland or range, pasture, forest and woodlands resulting from land uses or from a process or
                 combination of processes, including processes arising from human activities and habitation patterns.

        <h2>Impacts of Land Degradation !</h2>
        <p>As of today, almost a quarter of the world’s total land area has been degraded. This creates enormous problems not only for the billions
            of people who directly depend on agriculture, but it has far-reaching impacts affecting every single person on this planet today. These 
            impacts include food shortages, volatility and increases in food prices caused by declines in the productivity of croplands; heightened
            impacts of climate change globally caused by the release of carbon and nitrous oxide from degrading land; and the threat of social 
            instability from the forced migration that will result. 
            If current trends continue, 95% of the Earth’s land areas could become degraded within the next 30 years.

                    <p>
                        Located in northern China, this plateau has highly erodible soil that suffers from severe soil erosion due to over-farming
                        and deforestation. Although large-scale soil conservation efforts have been implemented here, land degradation remains a major
                         concern.

                        Australian rangelands are significantly affected by land degradation. Covering around 80% of the continent, these vast

                        degradation
